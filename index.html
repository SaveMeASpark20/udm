                    In 1995, the City College of Manila (CCM) was established through City Ordinance 7885, aiming to provide quality education to deserving graduates from public schools in Manila. Led by Mayor Alfredo S. Lim, CCM underwent a significant transformation in 2006 and became Universidad De Manila (UDM), a recognized university under City Ordinance No. 8120. UDM's growth continued with the recognition of its College Programs by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) in 2015. In 2020, UDM adapted to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing a Learning Management System (LMS) and adopting Moodle App as a remote blended learning platform. Despite the lockdown, UDM ensured an uninterrupted teaching and learning process, with students successfully meeting academic requirements.

        <p> Recognizing UDM's progress, the City of Manila enacted City Ordinance No. 8635, officially establishing UDM as an independent institutional department. UDM expanded its program offerings to include the Institute of Graduate and Professional Studies (IGPS), the College of Law (CoL), the Center for Micro-credentialing and Industry Training (CMIT), and the Senior High School (SHS). The achievements of UDM are made possible by the dedication and resilience of its faculty members, administrators, and students, who have embraced new technologies and overcome challenges to uphold academic excellence.</p>
